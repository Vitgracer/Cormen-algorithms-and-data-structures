# Cormen Algorithms in C++ (Just for Fun™)

Welcome to the land of loops and logic!  
This repo is a no-nonsense, all-algorithm tribute to the legendary *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen et al. — implemented entirely in C++. Because... why not?

## What's Inside?

All the classic hits:
- Sorting (because who wants unordered data?)
- Searching (for meaning... in arrays)
- Graphs (nodes and edges, not social drama)
- Dynamic Programming (a.k.a. brute force with a memory)
- Greedy stuff (like your ex)
- And more algorithmic mischief...

## Why

Because reading is good, but coding is better.  
Implementing it in C++ is *great*.  
Doing it for fun is **questionable**, but here we are.

## Requirements
C++
Brain cells (at least two)
No fear of recursion

## Disclaimer
No guarantees on efficiency, elegance, or sanity.
This is for educational purposes and mild entertainment.
